Originally built in 1998, The Bl anton Assisted Living building underwent a renovation to keep it aligned with C. C. Young’s mission of fostering premier environments where every life at every age is valued and enriched. C. C. Young takes great pride in providing residents and their guests with sophisticated, warm, modern spaces that invite interaction and peaceful relaxation, both inside their community and throughout the campus.  To accomplish this vision within the Blanton building, updates were especially needed within the common area on the first floor of the building. The modernization of this area consisted of an open show kitchen, an updated dining venue with private and semi-private dining rooms, a beautiful and elegant newly added fireplace to enhance residents and guests’ dining experience, multi-purpose rooms, and the library and lobby complete with a 235 gallon aquarium.

The renovation and inspiration can be described as one with clean lines, rich tonal blues that bring a calming tranquility to the space combined with organic elements of rich wood-clad columns, wood-slat ceilings, and back-lit glass panels inset with branch-like reeds to warm the overall environment. Updated cover lighting and striking pendants and sconces offer varying levels of light throughout the common spaces. A water theme of blue is carried out in fabrics, finishes, accessories and art and is amplified by the positioning of a large aquarium with dual-sided views from the entry, living areas, and the pathway to dining. A dual-sided ribbon fireplace, clad in natural white crystal stack stone creates drama and helps provide a more private retreat to diners.
