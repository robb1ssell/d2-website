Wesley Acres – Assisted Living Dining Renovation
D2 staff’s renovation of an existing dining area at Wesley Acres began with a conversation about how to make residents feel more at home while dining-in. A large, existing institutional floor plan was redesigned into two separate dining venues: casual dining and a bistro. The new space provides more choices and encourages more socialization and freedom of movement among residents.
