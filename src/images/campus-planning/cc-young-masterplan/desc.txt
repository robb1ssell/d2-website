Building on its mission to build an atmosphere that values people of all ages with daily opportunities for personal growth and creativity, C. C. Young has engaged D2 Architecture to develop a masterplan that will transform the existing campus.  Creating momentum for this, the campus recently installed the Sculpture Pavilion and Park that has already become a focal point for the community at large. Currently, D2 is designing the new Healthcare Center that will include additional Assisted Living residences, and will also house Memory Care Assisted Living, Skilled Nursing and Rehab. Once the Healthcare Center is complete, the existing Lawther Point East and West buildings and The Cove will be replaced by more Independent Living residences.
