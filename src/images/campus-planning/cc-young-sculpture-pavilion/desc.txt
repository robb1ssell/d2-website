Designed and built to represent creativity and vibrancy of life, the Sculpture Pavilion opens as a multi-use hub in the center of campus, complete with full audio/visual capabilities for performances, gatherings, and events and will feature various programming offerings throughout the year, available to residents and open to the Dallas/Fort Worth community.

The completion of the Central Park and the Sculpture Pavilion mark the beginning of a transformation for C. C. Young’s White Rock Lake campus as the senior living community embarks on the launch of a $186 million dollar master plan. This 10-year master plan includes six phases with an upgraded health center, expanded center for arts and education, and multiple enhancements to the campus’ independent living options.
