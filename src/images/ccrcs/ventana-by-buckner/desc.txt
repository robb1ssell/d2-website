Ventana by Buckner
Rising 12 stories above its urban setting, Ventana is a premier Continuing Care Retirement Center situated at the intersection of two of Dallas’ most established thoroughfares.  Located seven miles north of the downtown skyline, Ventana’s twin condominium towers of floor-to-ceiling glass windows offer 360-degree views of the surrounding metropolitan area.  Each of the two towers have a modest, yet noticeable, 15 degree bend at their center axes and are positioned on Ventana’s compact urban site to maximize these panoramic views. With its use of warm and ethereal materials and its integration of the Landscape design, Ventana offers pleasant and sophisticated spaces in which to dwell, live, and make memories.
At its core, the lower 5 stories of Ventana’s twin towers are linked and share varying levels of care and amenities for its residents. One story of Ventana is dedicated to rehabilitation, two stories are devoted to Green House-certified Skilled Nursing care and Assisted Living care, a Memory Support and Alzheimer’s Care unit is apportioned to one story, and Ventana’s remaining eight stories house Independent Living dwelling units and amenities. Amenities include a salon and spa, a grand hall for small and large gatherings, an indoor pool and jacuzzi room, outdoor cooking and living areas, wellness yoga and fitness rooms, a therapy pool, a roof top terrace with private patios, green space and raised planters for resident gardeners, a sky lounge at the 12th story, and 10 different food venues offering common, casual, or fine dining.
