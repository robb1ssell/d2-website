The Terraces at Los Altos

The Terraces at Los Altos is a charming CCRC in a residential neighborhood of Los Altos California. Originally started in 1954, it has grown slowly over the past 50 years and is now in need of radical re-invention. D2 has worked with many people, including the client, the staff and residents at The Terraces, the Neighborhood Association, the City, and OSHPD to create a dynamic, sensitive, and carefully phased re-invention of the community.
