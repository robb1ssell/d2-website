The Tradition-Lovers Lane’s Assisted Living and Memory Care Community is opening with cutting-edge technology for safety and care.  The Community – also designed with light-filled, beautiful common areas and apartments – will include a physical- and occupational-therapy center, a therapy pool with an underwater treadmill, 24-hour licensed nursing, a multi-sensory room, and medication management. This portion of the Tradition community includes 85 assisted living units and 25 memory care units in one four-story building. The facility will be generously served with nearly 60,000 square feet of commons and support space.
