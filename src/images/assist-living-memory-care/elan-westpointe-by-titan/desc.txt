Located among the highest elevations in New Braunfels, Élan Westpointe affords fantastic view of the surrounding landscape in all directions while reflecting the architectural vernacular of Texas Hill Country.  The new senior living community offers innovative design to assisted living and memory care residents starting with a long cantilevered covered drop off for easier queuing and less drop-off congestion. A stone rotunda greets visitors and organizes the circulation in the main commons area. The interiors are filled with daylight as amenity spaces are wrapped around courtyards and also have clerestory windows contributing to the individuality of the building.
