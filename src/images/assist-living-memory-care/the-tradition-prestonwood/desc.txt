The Tradition Prestonwood, a high-end rental senior living community, is adding a four-story assisted living and memory care building that will complement its existing independent living community.  The new construction has broken ground and is situated on 2.81 acres at 5555 Arapaho Road, which is catty-cornered from the original community located at 15250 Prestonwood Blvd. and Arapaho.  The new building will comprise 75 assisted living and 38 memory care apartments, totaling 138,000 square feet of construction.

The new building will be totally in keeping with the original Tradition-Prestonwood community, which is known for its beautiful, light-filled interiors and landscaped courtyards.  Paramount throughout the new assisted living and memory care communities will be state-of-the-art technology for safety and care; health and medication management systems; licensed nursing; assistance with bathing, dressing and grooming; flexible gourmet dining; a physical- and occupational-therapy center; a diverse activity calendar; a multi-sensory room; and a therapy pool with an underwater treadmill.  The apartments in the assisted living and memory care communities will be unusually spacious, with details similar to those of the apartments in the independent living community.
