This 325,000-square-foot healthcare center, connecting to the existing Blanton Assisted Living building, is a new, forward-thinking concept in the Senior Living, Senior Care industry. Multiple functional residential spaces are designed for group activities, hobbies and personal time, while large assisted living apartments are uniquely designed to be more independent and foster a sense of autonomy. The new center will add 221 new residences, which are adaptable for Assisted Living, Memory Care, Skilled Nursing, and Rehabilitation and will establish C. C. Young as a market leader.
