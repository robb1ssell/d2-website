            As we conclude our first year anniversary of D2U, or as you may recall the 
            coining of what we called The Year Under the Hood, we took the opportunity 
            to survey the faculty/staff (read: one in the same) about their experience, 
            their takeaways, their growth. If nothing else to determine if everyone had 
            in fact moved their dot on the chart up and the right. (
            <Link to='/d2u-summary'>Read original D2U manifesto here</Link>).
          </p>

          <p>
            And while the responses were universally, whole heartedly positive, we began 
            to notice a theme in the feedback: <strong><em>collaboration</em></strong>. We had set out to singularly 
            raise the acumen of each and every staff member by sharing our skills and insight 
            on a particular topic, and came away with a team less inhibited to ask questions 
            or share experiences that lead to the best solutions for our clients.

          <p>Here are some excerpts from our “course evaluations”:</p>

              “The Content side of D2U was one of the more helpful parts of the program for me. Going through 
              all the classes has already made me more aware of how parts of buildings are put together 
              and how the building works as a whole.”

              “Like history, if we do not learn from past mistakes we are doomed to repeat them.  
              Less repeated mistakes means we are freed up to do better design, expand our horizons, 
              and happier clients and people.  It elevates us to higher levels of creating, working, and living.”

              “The teachers (my coworkers) did a great job of breaking down complicated concepts 
              into digestible chunks. Having different perspectives from a number of seasoned 
              veterans all in the same room was invaluable as well. At the end of the day, I’m 
              very thankful for my time spent in D2U and I know it will pay dividends for years to come.”

              “It was inspiring to see D2ers (people of D2 Architecture) come together once a week 
              to share their knowledge, leading for D2 to grow together. Content apprentices along 
              with media apprentices moving parallel towards one common goal; making D2 an even more 
              collaborative, responsive TEAM.”

            As we have all come to understand, when we leverage our resources correctly, we deliver 
            creative, more efficient solutions. But first we need to know what (who) our resources 
            are. Our projects require the coordinated resources of many talented people who rely on 
            each other to successfully “wow” our clients.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout the past year, D2 has developed an open environment to share our abilities, 
            challenges, and lessons learned that now constitutes a robust body of knowledge rooted 
            in collaboration. We were nothing if not inspired by one another for sharing their stories 
            and expertise. As Henry Ford once said, <em>“Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together 
            is progress. Working together is success.”</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            So what’s next you ask? There will be some celebration, but we are far from done. 
            D2U left us learning for more and we have set in place a syllabus for D2U.2 with longer 
            (less frequent) sessions, immersing ourselves in topics integral to our work both 
            inside and outside the office.
